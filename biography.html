<h1 class="my-5">Rizal's Educational Background</h1>
<ul>
    <p>Rizal’s mother, Doña Teodora was his first teacher. Doña Teodora was patient, conscientious, and understanding. She also discovered that Rizal had a talent for poetry, and encouraged him to write poems.</p>
</ul>
<h3>Private Tutors</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Maestro Celestino</li>
    <li>Maestro Lucas</li>
    <li>Leon Monroy</li>

<ul>
    <p>Rizal went to Biñan on June 1869. He was accompanied by his older brother Paciano, and taught by Maestro Justiniano.</p>
    <p>In academic studies, Rizal beat all Biñan boys. He surpassed them in Spanish, Latin, and other subjects.</p>
</ul>
<h3>Ateneo</h3>
<ul>
    <p>Rizal entered Ateneo in 1872. He belonged to the class composed of Spaniards, mestizos, and Filipinos. However, he was considered as an inferior and was placed at the bottom of the class.</p>
    <p>By the end of the month, he became the emperor and received a prize: a religious picture.</p>
    <p>Rizal graduated on March 23, 1877, attaining sobresaliente or excellent with 5 medals. He received the degree of Bachelor of Arts.</p>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3>Medical Studies in University of Sto. Thomas</h3>
<ul>
    <pre>1877 - 1882</pre>
    <p>He continued his education at UST and finished a year in Philosophy and Letters after deciding to shift to a medical course. He made the decision for him to be a physician and be able to treat his mother's failing eyesight. Fr. Pablo Ramon, the Father Rector of Ateneo whom he consulted recommended medicine.</p>
    <p>He studied Cosmology, Metaphysics, Theodicy, and History of Philosophy.</p>
    <p>While UST was under Dominicans, the rival of Jesuits that established Ateneo, Rizal remained loyal to Ateneo.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
    <pre>Pre-Med Course</pre>
    <p>Out of the 28 young men taking Ampliacion only four including Rizal were granted the privilege of taking simultaneously the preparatory course and the first year of medicine.</p>
    <p>Rizal also received his four year practical training in medicine at the Hospital de San Juan de Dios in Intramuros</p>
    <p>During his last year at the University, Rizal had obtained the global grade of Notable (Very Good) in all of his subjects, and he was the second best student in a decimated class of seven who passed the medicine course. After which, Rizal decided to study in Spain.</p>
</ul>
<h3>Academic Journey To Spain</h3> 
<ul>
    <pre>1882 - 1885</pre>
    <p>His departure for Spain was kept secret from Spanish Authorities, friars and even his parents especially his mother because she would not allow him to go. To avoid detection, he used the name Jose Mercado.</p>
    <p>On May 3, 1882 he boarded on Salvadora bound for Singapore where he was the only Filipino passenger.</p>
    <p>On November 3, 1882, he enrolled in Universidad Central de Madrid taking up two courses: Philosophy an Letters and Medicine.</p>
    <p>On June 21, 1884, he conferred the degree of Licentiate in Medicine.</p>
    <p>The following academic year, he studied and passed all subjects leading to the degree of doctor of medicine. Unfortunately, he was not able to submit the thesis required for graduation nor paid the corresponding fees. With that, he was not awarded his Doctor’s Diploma.</p>
    <p>Rizal also finished his studies in Philosophy and Letters with higher grades. He was awarded the Degree of Licentiate in Philosophy and Letters by the Universidad Central de Madrid June 19, 1885 with the rating of excellent.</p>
</ul>
<h3>Opthalmology studies and travels in Europe</h3>
<ul>
    <p>Jose Rizal went to Paris and Germany in order to specialize in ophthalmology. Among all branches, he chose this specialization because he wanted to cure his mother’s failing eyesight.</p>
    <p>In 1885, after studying at the Universidad Central de Madrid, Rizal, who was then 24 years old, went to Paris to acquire more knowledge in ophthalmology.</li>
    <p>Rizal found friends in Europe:</p>
        <li>Maximo Viola</li>
        <li> Señor Eusebio Corominas</li>
        <li>Don Miguel Morayta</li>
        <li> Dr. Louis de Weckert</li>
    <p class="my-3">On February 3, 1886, after gathering some experience in ophthalmology, he left Paris and went to Heidelberg, Germany.</p>
    <p>He worked at the University Eye Hospital under the direction of Dr. Otto Becker, a distinguished German ophthalmologist.</p>
    <p>On April 22, 1886, Rizal wrote a poem entitled A Las Flores de Heidelberg (To the Flowers of Heidelberg) because he was fascinated by the blooming flowers along the Neckar River, which was the light blue flower called “forget-me-not”.</p>
    <p>On August 14, 1886, Rizal arrived in Leipzig. There, he attended some lectures at the University of Leipzig on history and psychology.</p>
    <p>Rizal chose to reside in Germane longer for the following reasons:</p>
    <p>To gain further his studies in science and languages.</p>
    <p>To observe the economic and political conditions of the German nation.</p>
    <p>To associate with the famous scientists and scholars.</p>
    <p>Lastly to publish his novel Noli Me Tangere</p>
    <p>Jose Rizal earned a Licentiate in Medicine at the Universidad Central de Madrid, where he also took courses in philosophy and literature. It was in Madrid that he began writing Noli Me Tangere. He also attended classes in the University of Paris and, in 1887, he completed his eye specialization course at the University of Heidelberg. It was also in that year that Rizal’s first novel was published in Berlin.</p>

<h1 class="mx-auto my-5" id="monuments">Rizal Monuments Around the World</h1>

<div class="monument mx-auto">
    
    <p>
        There is an anecdote about how, when he was a little boy, Jose Rizal was glimpsed by his sisters Olimpia, Maria and Lucia at the back of their small nipa hut in their Calamba ancestral home, busy molding some historical figures.
    </p>
    <p>
        They “laughed and teased him about his crude work.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “All right,” he told them, “laugh at me now, but in the future, see if people will make statues of me.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Those words, expressed in childhood innocence, proved strangely prophetic. They are remembered these days in the run-up to Dec. 30, when the nation commemorates the 120th death anniversary and martyrdom of Rizal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, we have statues and monuments of Rizal in virtually every town or city plaza around the archipelago, as well as countless monuments of stone, granite or bronze not only in the Philippines but in four continents—in Asia, Europe, North America and Latin America.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rizal sculptures bearing his likeness also stand in different parts of the world, even in places he never set foot in.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are also plaques, historical markers installed in Philippine embassies in host countries, educational centers and special locations in places with overseas Filipino communities.
    </p>
    <p>
        The list of countries is too long. Rizal monuments stand today in several countries that recognize him for his significant literary and scientific contributions, wide influence, outstanding achievements, intelligence and heroism.
    </p>

    <h3 class="my-5">Singapore</h3>

    <p>
        Rizal visited Singapore four times. The first of his many visits to foreign lands was a two-day stopover in Singapore in 1882, where he went on a sightseeing of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
        He left Singapore for Europe on May 11, 1882, and returned to the city on May 17,1892. This was to be his last visit to Singapore, for not long after this, he was executed on Dec. 30, 1896.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2005, on the anniversary of Rizal’s birth, President Nathan of Singapore and the National Heritage Board unveiled a memorial near the Asian Civilization Museum, featuring a bronze medallion of Rizal by a Filipino artist to commemorate his various sojourns in the city.

    <p>
        Madre España, of course, should have the monument of her Philippine son. Rizal stayed in Madrid for most of his European sojourn, from 1882 to 1891.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hearrived in Madrid for the first time in May 1882 after his medical studies at University of Santo Tomas.
    </p>
    <p>
        In his diary, he wrote: “Madrid is one of the pleasant cities of the world; it partakes at the same time of the spirit of Europe and of the Orient.”
    </p>
    <p>
        He did literary, artistic and patriotic pursuits, despite the many attractions and joyous sounds of Madrid.
    </p>
    <p>
        A statue of the Philippine martyr and national hero stands in a prominent, well-traveled part of the Spanish capital.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Rizal monument is located in a well-lighted and landscaped 70-meter corner lot in Parque Santander along Avenida de Filipinas in downtown Madrid.
    </p>
    <p>
        The monument, similar to that in Luneta, has a four-meter-high bronze statue sculpted by Filipino artist Florante Caedo. It was unveiled on Dec. 5, 1996. The statue is placed beside the monument of the South American hero, Simon Bolivar.

        On Feb. 3, 1888, Rizal left Manila for Hong Kong. This was where he served his self-imposed exiled in 1888.
    </p>
    <p>
        From December 1891 to June 1892, he lived with his family at No. 5 D’Aguilar St., No. 2, Rednaxela Terrace, where he opened a medical clinic as an ophthalmic surgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
        This site has a marker installed by Hong Kong Antiquities and Monuments Office. It reads in English and Chinese:
    </p>
    <p>
        “Dr. Jose Rizal (1861-1896) National hero of the Philippines lived in this area with his family from December 1891 to June 1892.”

    <p>
        One of the happiest interludes in Rizal’s life was his sojourn in the Land of the Cherry Blossom for 45 days from Feb. 28 to April 13, 1888.
    </p>
    <p>
        On Feb. 18,1888, Rizal arrived in Yokahoma and registered at the grand Tokyo Hotel. He proceeded the next day to Tokyo Hotel where he was billeted from March 2 to 7, and then transferred to the Spanish Legation.
    </p>
    <p>
        He immediately worked on learning the habits, customs and tradition of the Japanese people, their culture, language, theater and commerce.
    </p>
    <p>
        He was charmed by “the natural beauty of Japan, the manners of the Japanese people, the picturesque dress and simple charm of the Japanese women, the scenic panoramas and shrines and industry of the Japanese people.”
    </p>
    <p>
        He also fell in love with a Japanese girl, “whose loveliness infused joy and romance in his sorrowing heart.” Her real name was Seiko Usui.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hibiya Park is the first Western-styled park in Japan located on a tranquil corner of the busy city of Ginza, which opened in 1903.
    </p>
    <p>
        A bust of Rizal was erected on the site of the grand hotel where he stayed in 1888. The marker reads:
    </p>
    <p>
        “DR. JOSE RIZAL NATIONAL HERO OF THE PHILIPPINES STAYED IN 1888 AT TOKYO HOTEL”

    <p>
        Rizal first saw America on April 28, 1888, and visited the cities of New York, Oakland, Reno, Chicago and Boston.
    </p>
    <p>
He wrote in his diary: “I visited the great cities of America, with their grandiose edifices, their electric lights, and their great conceptions. America is, undoubtedly, a great country, but she has many defects.”
    </p>
    <p>
        It was reported by the Asian Journal that “monuments of Rizal stand in eight US cities: Juneau, Alaska; Kauai and Lihue in Hawaii; Chicago, Illinois; Orlando, Florida; California; Cherry Hill in New Jersey; New York City and Seattle.
    </p>
    <p>
        The seven-foot bronze statue sculpted by Filipino artist Toym de Leon Imao, mounted on a six-foot granite pedestal, is the ninth statue of Rizal in Carson City, California.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was a gift of the Philippine government to Carson City as part of the celebration of the 150th birth anniversary of the Philippine national hero.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rizal left New York for Liverpool, England, on May 16, 1888.

As much as possible, he did not wish fowls to be killed even for food, and showed displeasure in being asked to eat the cooked animal.
